# Libby's Book Co-op

This is a place to reflect on books.

There are two rules.

1. It costs $5 to join for life.
2. You must write a reaction to a book within 48 hours of finishing it, or otherwise provide an explanation for why you couldnâ€™t write one within 48 hours. 

The membership fee is to cover operational costs, e.g. hosting and storage.
